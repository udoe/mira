Minimalist Internet Radio

(date of creation: February 2024)

This is a project to implement our own internet radio for everyday use. We created a simple GUI with a status line for the currently played song and radio station, a title bar with date, time and the current signal strength and eight buttons with configurable radio stations.

The program was built and tested for following hardware and software components:

Software:

- Python version: 3.12.2
- Raspberry Pi OS (based on Debian 12 (Bookwworm))

Hardware:
- Raspberry Pi 4 Model B
- touch-sensitive display for Raspberry Pi 4 (any touch-sensitive display for Raspberry Pi 4 should work, but some may need further configurations within Raspberry Pi OS)
- HiFi Berry DAC Plus (any HiFi Berry should work, configuration of Raspberry Pi OS will vary, see step-by-step guide/HiFi Berry)
